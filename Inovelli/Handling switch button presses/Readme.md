# Blueprints for handling switch button presses
Please see the blueprints above for Inovelli Blue and Red series switches. Blueprints support all Blue and Red Series switches, although I have not personally tested all of the Red models. Blue Series scripts are only compatible with ZHA.

## Confirmed models these scripts support
### Blue Series (ZHA)
* Dimmer (VZM31-SN)
* Fan (VZM35-SN)
* On/Off (VZM30-SN)
* mmWave (VZM32-SN)

### Red Series (Z-Wave)
* mmWave (VZW32-SN)
* Other models _should_ work, but have not been tested
