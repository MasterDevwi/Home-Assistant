# Blueprints for handling switch button presses
Please see the blueprints above for Inovelli Blue and Red series switches. Blueprints support all Blue and Red Series switches, although I have not personally tested all of the Red models.

## Confirmed models these scripts support include:
### Blue Series
* Dimmer (VZM31-SN)
* Fan (VZM35-SN)
* On/Off (VZM30-SN)
* mmWave (VZM32-SN)

### Red Series
* mmWave (VZW32-SN)
